# Master's Thesis code repository

The _BenchTDA_ folder contains the benchmarking suite; the benchmarking tool is contained in _\_benchmark.py_, the dataset generators used are contained in _datasets.py_, and the code used to sample from the manifolds is contained in _manifolds.py_.

The _ExamplePipelines_ folder contains the FSC and PH functions of the TDA pipelines, and the model and vectorization classes of all of the pipelines.

The _run\_benchmark.py_ file can be used in combination with the conda environment in _environment.yml_ to run the tests presented in the thesis.
